In this coding challenge, you need to build an autocomplete that will act as a payment page where users can enter their UPI. The autocomplete form should suggest possible UPI handles based on the user input.

Functional Spec:

Based on the user input, you need to show the best-matched list of UPI handles.
There should be an inline suggestion of the best matched UPI handle.
The user should be able to select from the list by clicking on a list item or using the keyboard.
If a best-matched suggestion is visible inline and the user clicks on the right arrow, the suggestion should be auto-filled.
You need to handle different edge cases.
Feel free to add any other functionality you think would be useful for the end user.
