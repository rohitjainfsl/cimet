Read the below mentioned specifications and make sure all are met.

	The system here is an Age Validator. It tells if a user is eligible to use the services or not.
	The user's age >= 18 years to use the services i.e. to be eligible.
	Date Of Birth is a required field.
	If user is eligible then show the success message else ineligible message on form submission.
	On form submission, show an error if the DOB is missing.
	Clicking on Why do we need to know this? CTA should toggle the message box stating the required information.
